## Project Summary: 
Agenda of the project was to use existing state of the art architecture and utilize transfer learning technique to merge into a Single encoder --> Multi decoder achitecure. This model would take a input and give outs for both Object Detection and Depth Estimation. Here are the base models on which the architecture is inspired from: 
1. [Yolov3](https://github.com/theschoolofai/YoloV3)
2. [MiDaS](https://github.com/intel-isl/MiDaS)
